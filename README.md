Facebook Group Data Scraper
This Python script utilizes the Facebook Graph API to scrape data from a specified Facebook group. It retrieves the group name, posts, comments on the posts, and relevant information such as the number of comments, number of likes, and usernames associated with each post and comment. The scraped data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis or storage.

Usage
Replace the placeholder values in the script with your own Facebook app credentials and user access token. The required fields are:

app_id: Your Facebook application ID.
app_secret: Your Facebook application secret.
user_access_token: Your user access token obtained from Facebook.
group_id: The ID of the Facebook group from which you want to scrape data.
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

Copy
python script.py
The script will scrape the group data and store it in a CSV file named <group_name>_data.csv.

Configuration
Before running the script, make sure to replace the following variables with your own values:

python
Copy
app_id = "YOUR_APP_ID"
app_secret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
user_access_token = "YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
group_id = "YOUR_GROUP_ID"
You can obtain the app_id and app_secret by creating a Facebook application and generating the necessary credentials. The user_access_token can be obtained by following Facebook's authentication process. The group_id represents the ID of the Facebook group you want to scrape data from.
